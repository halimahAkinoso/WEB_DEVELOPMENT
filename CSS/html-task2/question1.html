        <h3 class="h3">i'm Esther  Egharevba  ,an aspiring Ai Developer </h3>
        <p class="st">A month ago, I stepped into something new, something big. I joined the AI Fellowship Program in Abeokuta, a six-month immersive experience in artificial intelligence, made possible by the visionary support of Dr. Bosun Tijani, Minister of Communications, Innovation and Digital Economy ,Public AI, Ogun state Government, Nigerian Communications Commission.
            I didn’t know exactly what to expect. But from day one, it’s been a whirlwind of learning, growth, and connection. We started with the fundamentals of Python, and already I’ve begun to grasp the building blocks of programming: data types, control flow, functions, OOP, error handling, file operations, and working with libraries like  and Pandas to make sense of data. It’s challenging, yes, but also deeply exciting.
            What’s made this journey even more powerful is the community. I’m surrounded by mentors who genuinely care and peers who push me to think bigger. Every session feels like a step forward, not just in skill, but in confidence.
            I often think about how rare and special this opportunity is. It’s not just a program, it’s a platform. A space where young Nigerians like me are being equipped to shape the future of tech in Africa. And for that, I’m deeply thankful to Dr. Tijani. His belief in our potential and his commitment to digital empowerment is more than inspiring, it’s life-changing.
            There’s still so much ahead. More code to write, more ideas to explore, more solutions to build. But I’m here for it. Fully present. Fully committed.
            This is just the beginning. </p>
        <h2 class="h2"> My First Step into Web Development </h2>
        <p class="stor">
        I’m so excited to share something special—my very first web project, built with HTML and CSS, as part of my journey in the AI Fellowship Program! 
        This was more than just learning how to code—it was about turning ideas into something real and meaningful. I got hands-on with front-end development, learning how to structure content with HTML and bring it to life with CSS. Watching a blank page transform into a message-driven website was honestly magical.
        What I built:
        A responsive webpage titled Hope for the Future, designed to raise awareness about drug abuse among teenagers—a cause I deeply care about. It’s simple, but it carries a powerful message.
        Campaign Message: Say No to Drug Abuse
        The page highlights:
        - The dangers of drug abuse
        - Health and mental consequences
        - Legal risks and academic impact
        - A call to action: Join the Movement
        Skills I gained along the way:
        - HTML5 fundamentals
        - CSS layout and styling
        - Debugging and browser testing
        This project helped me realize how tech can be a tool for advocacy and change.  I’m even more excited for what’s ahead. If you’re also exploring web development or AI, I’d love to connect and learn from your journey too! </p>
